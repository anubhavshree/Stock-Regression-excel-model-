  ACC Cement Stock Regression Model (Excel)

This repository contains a simple Excel-based regression model built using 1,258 days of ACC Cement data along with Nifty 50 and Gold prices.  
The goal was to check if these factors can predict short-term stock returns.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- R² ≈ 0.0036 → Very low explanatory power  
- All variables are statistically insignificant  
- Short-term stock movements are mostly noise (supports EMH)

## 📁 File Included
- `ACC_regression_model.xlsx` – Full dataset + regression output

## 🎯 Why This Project Matters
This project helped me practice:
- Data cleaning and return calculation in Excel  
- Running regression using the Data Analysis ToolPak  
- Interpreting financial & statistical results  

Great learning experience in quantitative finance and Excel modeling.
